# BrewPi-Django and Spark-based Controllers

Currently, BrewPi-Django does not support Spark-based controllers. Support for Spark based controllers is planned, but will be implemented later in the development path. (Currently planned for v3 or later) 

Once implemented, BrewPi-Django will support controlling both legacy (Arduino/Fuscus) and modern (Spark) controllers from the same installation.
