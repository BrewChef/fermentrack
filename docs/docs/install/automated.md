# Automated Installation on Raspberry Pi

To help simplify installation, a custom install script has been created as part of the brewpi-django-tools repo. To install using this script, do the following:

1. Log into your Raspberry Pi
2. install `git` (Type `sudo apt-install git`)
3. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/thorrak/brewpi-django-tools.git`)
4. Run the install script (`sudo brewpi-django-tools/install-django-stack.sh`)
5. Follow the prompts on screen. Relaunch the install script if prompted.
6. Once installation completes, open a web browser and connect to brewpi-django to complete the installation process.

Thats it!
