# Fermentrack and Fuscus (Native Python Controller)

Currently, Fermentrack does not support serial connections to controllers and therefore, due to the way it is implemented, does not directly support Fuscus - the native python implementation of the BrewPi controller firmware. Support for serial connections is considered a key missing feature, and is scheduled to be developed soon after the initial release.

Once serial connections are implemented, Fermentrack should support connections to Fuscus via the "advanced" setup workflow in a manner similar to the Arduino implementation.

Further down the development path are other features involving Fuscus such as direct installation and configuration management.
