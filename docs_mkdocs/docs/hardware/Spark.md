# Fermentrack and Spark-based Controllers

Currently, Fermentrack does not support Spark-based controllers. Support for Spark based controllers is planned, but will be implemented later in the development path. (Currently planned for v3 or later)

Once implemented, Fermentrack will support controlling both legacy (Arduino/Fuscus) and modern (Spark) controllers from the same installation.
